83481 lines of Java by sloccount (including the double-count of the svnkit stuff)
Initial run: 7931 errors 

+10 minutes (0:10): 6978 mostly by annotating the top-level classes in the most 'errorful' files @UIType
Note: Running the checker over the whole source base (every line other than the extra svnkit stuff)
takes about 35 seconds.
+5 minutes (0:15): 6460 by more UIType annos, and marking a few anonymous inner class methods @UIEffect
