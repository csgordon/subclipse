83481 lines of Java by sloccount (including the double-count of the svnkit stuff)
Initial run: 7931 errors 

+10 minutes (0:10): 6978 mostly by annotating the top-level classes in the most 'errorful' files @UIType
Note: Running the checker over the whole source base (every line other than the extra svnkit stuff)
takes about 35 seconds.
+5 minutes (0:15): 6460 by more UIType annos, and marking a few anonymous inner class methods @UIEffect
+15 minutes (0:30): 5464 by more of the same
+15 minutes (0:45): 4695 by more of the same
+15 minutes (1:00): 4220 much of the same, annotating all the dialog subclasses @UIType, and marking BusyIndicator.showWhile as taking a @UI Runnable
+20 minutes (1:20): 3954 marking some @UI Runnables and making an actions subpackage @UIPackage (lots of invalid isEnabled() overrides)
+5 min (1:25): 3441 by making the .wizards subpackage @UIPackage
+5 min (1:30): 2555 by making .wizards.dialogs and .dialogs @UIPackage
+5 min (1:35): 2095 by making .conflicts and .wizards.sharing @UIPackage
+5 min (1:40): 1759 by making graph.editors, graph.popup.actions, and ui.subscriber @UIPackage
+5 min (1:45): 1073, using a script that takes a package name and spits out an appropriate package-info.java with @UIPackage
+5 min (1:50): 834 by making AnnotateView @UIType and .decorators @UIPackage

Apparently much of this was false progress.  I fixed a bug in the checker: @UIPackage should not
make anonymous inner classes @UIType, since they're often supposed to be effect-polymorphic closure
types... So we're back to 2469...

+10 min (2:00): 2312
+10 min (2:10): 2168
+15 min (2:25): 798 after fixing a few checker bugs and changing the anonymous inner class method defaults to inheriting the lowest overridden effect
+35 min (3:00): 568
+5 min (3:05): 560
+10 min (3:15): 483 by scripting to mark all "new Runnable" passed to [a]syncExec as @UI
+10 min (3:25): 426 by scripting to mark the BusyIndicator Runnables @UI, and fixing a couple missing imports.

Interesting to note that IWorkbenchSite.getShell(), specified as safe apparently by IShellProvider, says in its docs that it's not intended to be called from outside the UI thread, because the resulting display may be wrong.  This is dozens of errors removed in SVNHistoryPage, but with questionable semantics.

+45 min (4:10): 424 after undoing a few wrong annos and going back up to 500, followed by fine-grained annotation
+60 min (5:10): 354 fine-grained annotation
+20 min (5:30): 319
+60 min (6:30): 300 after tons of finnagling with SVNHistoryPage, then switching to knocking off the 1-error files
+15 min (6:45): 277 fine-grained annotation
