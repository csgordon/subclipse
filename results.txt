83481 lines of Java by sloccount (including the double-count of the svnkit stuff)
Initial run: 7931 errors 

+10 minutes (0:10): 6978 mostly by annotating the top-level classes in the most 'errorful' files @UIType
Note: Running the checker over the whole source base (every line other than the extra svnkit stuff)
takes about 35 seconds.
+5 minutes (0:15): 6460 by more UIType annos, and marking a few anonymous inner class methods @UIEffect
+15 minutes (0:30): 5464 by more of the same
+15 minutes (0:45): 4695 by more of the same
+15 minutes (1:00): 4220 much of the same, annotating all the dialog subclasses @UIType, and marking BusyIndicator.showWhile as taking a @UI Runnable
+20 minutes (1:20): 3954 marking some @UI Runnables and making an actions subpackage @UIPackage (lots of invalid isEnabled() overrides)
+5 min (1:25): 3441 by making the .wizards subpackage @UIPackage
+5 min (1:30): 2555 by making .wizards.dialogs and .dialogs @UIPackage
+5 min (1:35): 2095 by making .conflicts and .wizards.sharing @UIPackage
+5 min (1:40): 1759 by making graph.editors, graph.popup.actions, and ui.subscriber @UIPackage
+5 min (1:45): 1073, using a script that takes a package name and spits out an appropriate package-info.java with @UIPackage
+5 min (1:50): 834 by making AnnotateView @UIType and .decorators @UIPackage

Apparently much of this was false progress.  I fixed a bug in the checker: @UIPackage should not
make anonymous inner classes @UIType, since they're often supposed to be effect-polymorphic closure
types... So we're back to 2469...

+10 min (2:00): 2312
+10 min (2:10): 2168
+15 min (2:25): 798 after fixing a few checker bugs and changing the anonymous inner class method defaults to inheriting the lowest overridden effect
